Unrequited love is NOT for the weak. Like, what do you mean im head over heels for someone who dosent think about me the same way? What do you mean he dosent wake up waiting for a good morning text from me? What do you mean he cant wait to go home and pray that ill be on to say hi? What do you mean everytime i text him, he dosent smile at it? What do you mean he dosent hope every notification is from me? What do you mean he dosent want our calls to end? What do you mean he dosent stay up at night thinking about me? What do you mean he dosent beat himself up about not making a move? What do you mean he dosent cry at night wishing I could feel the same way about him? What do you mean. What could you possibly mean. Why. Why? Why cant he love me? Is something wrong with me? Do i care too much? Im not being pushy... am I? I care about him too much. Im scared to lose him. I just wish i could tell him. I really do. But i cant. Because ill ruin everything we have. That hurts more than just being silent. I wish he could care as much as i do for him. That would be the dream. But dreams are just dreams. They are not reality. And that hurts.
